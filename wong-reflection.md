What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I initally had some trouble wrapping my head around git branches and how merging them into the master branch worked. I also wasn't really sure of what the point of a pull request was.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS? 
I had not encountered a merge conflict yet, so it was definitely helpful to see a staged one and how to fix the issue. To be honest, I probably would've freaked out a little bit had I come across one in the initial module exercise, so I'm glad I got to see it in a controlled environment so to speak.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked the guide what the difference between git fetch and git pull is, and the answer is that git pull is basically an amalgam of git fetch and git merge. Git pull is apparently used more frequently, but git fetch is useful if you have code that you know is faulty and want to send it to someone else for assistance without merging it.

What still confuses you about Git? 
A lot of the commands aren't very intuitive. I think it'll all come together with practice though. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I think it went very well. It was a little bit awkward sharing feedback, but I appreciated the feedback that I received, and more importantly, it was actionable feedback so now I'm aware of something I need to work on in the future.
