# GPS 1.1 Release 7: Reflect

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  
  * I don't really feel that I was struggling with the *concepts* so much as becoming comfortable with the workflow. There are surely also details regarding Git workflow of which I am not even aware.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

  *  Our guide explained that the difference between a fetch and a pull id that fetch pulls the branch down without merging them to the local copy. This allows you to review and modify their changes before adding them.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  * What is the difference between fetch and pull?

* What still confuses you about Git?

  * The way that merges to the master are handled is still not entirely clear to me. When we were creating our merge conflict, for some reason the awesome-page.md file did not have any of the changes we had made to it.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

  * Going through the workflow with a partner was very helpful. Having someone there to keep me on track and help clarify my thought process was great!
